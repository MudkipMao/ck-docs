At the exact time the drop starts, you can either refresh your browser or click the refresh button in the middle. Keep in mind that if you click the refresh button, you will need to wait a few seconds until you click again.

If the load went smoothly, you should see something like the picture below. If not, you may need to try refreshing again.

Click the “join” button and you should be put into queue. If you don’t see text below the loading bar, you are not in queue. Try refreshing and clicking “join” again.
